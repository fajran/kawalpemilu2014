# Design and Architecture of Kawal Pemilu 2014

## Background

The Indonesian presidential election 2014 was held on 9 July. The [quick count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_count)
results on that day were inconclusive (see [the summary by Prof. Merlyna Lim](http://on.fb.me/1kb1y7O)).
To help clear the confusion and fear of vote manipulations, [kawalpemilu.org](https://kawalpemilu.org) is
set up. This solution was only possible because all the polling station (**TPS**)
data (**C1 scans**) were openly available by the national election commission (**KPU**)
for public scrutiny and verification.

## Our Goal

**To guard the election** by organizing the C1 scans released by the KPU, digitize
it, and make it easily accessible for the public to see the real count of the
aggregated votes from the polling stations to the village, district, regency,
province, up to the national level and provide a way to report back any anomaly
on any level to get it verified and fixed.

## Technical Challenges

* Over 470,000 C1 scans needs to be digitized manually. The process cannot be
  automated since the existing OCR tools do not work well enough to recognize
  handwriting. Other problems include upside down and slanted scans, blurry
  scans, and the tally boxes being occupied by multiple digits written
  vertically.

* Accurate digitization of the C1 scans via [crowdsourcing has its own challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M8nVgVARp4ymg5G7NPnGqR3qvh5TiPYjXM8FIMKuH_I/edit).
  We quickly learned from other crowdsourcing efforts that **verifying** the
  data entered by volunteers can be a difficult task by itself.

* Only 12 days left until the official announcement by KPU. We needed to design
  the data-entry to be fast, convenient, and “addictive” as possible to meet
  the deadline. The challenge here is that sometimes KPU website was not
  accessible for some period of time. Thus, we needed to design the data-entry
  system to be unaffected by the availability of the KPU website. That is,
  hot-linking the C1 scan images may not work.

* KPU website may become unavailable at any time. We had a concern that after
  we went public, KPU may stop serving the C1 scans to public (for any reason)
  and our effort would grind to a halt. With this concern, we needed to
  download and cache as many C1 scans as possible to guarantee availability
  before we went public. Additionally, we can use this resource to later
  identify if KPU make changes to their C1 scans.

## Our Design

Our system is designed to put an emphasis on the following factors: simplicity,
speed for data entry, accuracy and authenticity of the provided information,
and availability. Furthermore, we empower the viewers to report errors in the
data entry process or in the C1 scans themselves.  Simplicity. We only show
what’s necessary: navigation to drill down from national level to the TPS level
and provides data entry side-by-side with the C1 scan. Also, viewers should be
able to go back and forward while navigating (achieved by using HTML5 History
API on our single-page AJAX-based site).

* **Shareability**. We would like the viewers to be able to share exactly what
  they see on our site, especially the particular geographical location the
  viewer drilled down into. This is a typical stumbling block for a single-page
  AJAX-based website like ours, but can be solved by implementing an hash-based
  URL solution which allowed viewers to share e.g.
  [http://www.kawalpemilu.org/#0.78203.79629](https://2014.kawalpemilu.org/#0.78203.79629).
  We believe this shareability factor later contributed to the viral growth of
  the site’s traffic, because viewers can share information most pertinent to
  them (e.g. vote count for their hometown) to their friends. Another benefit
  is it makes it easier for viewers (and also us the developers) to share and
  report errors found.

* **Speed**. We’d like to have a very quick data entry (e.g., ~5 seconds per
  TPS) thus the server needs to be very responsive and the user interface must
  be friendly enough. That is, it supports quick entry using keyboard (via tab
  shortcut) and automatically jump to the next available C1 scan form when
  submitted. See the [data entry demo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=1454229121512383&set=vb.1452601258341836&type=3&theater).

* **Accuracy**. We want the volunteers to be very focused on the accuracy of
  the numbers they entered to avoid double work of fixing it later. We
  automatically compute the total legal votes (“suara sah”) and the user can
  use this as a means to double check their input on the first two fields and
  fix if the sum is incorrect. Sometimes when the sum from the C1 scans itself
  is incorrect, the entry is flagged and the sum can be temporarily mismatch.
  It can be verified fixed later by other volunteers.

* **Authentication**. We deliberately put the trusted volunteer’s name on the
  entry that they input, linking it to their Facebook account. This keeps them
  honest, no matter which candidate they are favoring to. We do not want
  anonymous users to do the data entry since it could severely damage the
  quality and would make it very hard to find and fix later as other
  crowdsourcing effort experienced (e.g., they need to ask another volunteer to
  re-enter the same TPS for sanity check, which slowdown the progress by at
  least twice). With authentication in place, we found very few errors made by
  the trusted volunteers. The names of the volunteers are not made public. They
  are disclosed only among the trusted volunteers.

* **Addictive**. We would like the users to get addicted to data entry. We’ve
  thought about gamification where one can maintain a rank list, but it may
  backfire since the user may change focus on speed rather than accuracy. After
  playing around with the design, we think that the users will get a small
  reward when they finished entering data for a particular village. They can
  roll up the hierarchy and see who is winning. We think that this good enough
  to keep the user motivated to continue digitizing the next village.

* **Security**. Due to the lack of available development time, we do not have
  advanced security features other than authentication for data entry and input
  sanitation. Thus it is important that we kept the data entry system private
  among the trusted volunteers. We assume that the trusted volunteers we
  recruited would not try to crack the data-entry system. We used a separate
  application for publishing the data for untrusted users (i.e., the public).
  We deployed a read-only Google App Engine (GAE) application for the public
  facing website (i.e., the kawalpemilu.org). GAE has a built in security
  features and is robust enough to handle the most common DDoS attack (by
  automatically spinning up additional instances when the load goes up).

  The original public version relied on a shared hosting server in Dreamhost to
  host the index.html page. Due to the heavy load and DDoS attacks, this was
  later moved to GAE (as part of the same application) using the custom domain
  feature. We do have contingency plan in case the internal website was exposed
  to public and compromised. We backup the crowdsourced data periodically and
  at anytime we can host another (secret) internal website easily within one
  hour.

* **Error Reporting**. This feature is unique to kawalpemilu.org. We used the
  same crowdsourcing strategy for error reporting. We provide the public facing
  website a way to submit an error report with notes using Google Forms into a
  Google Spreadsheet. For the (secret) internal website, the volunteers can
  just click the TPS that contains either data entry error or C1 scan errors.
  The error reports are aggregated to the upper level up to the national level
  so that one can easily track which regions needs further investigation. This
  helps the KPU to track and fix the errors. The group of the trusted
  volunteers (some of them were KPU employees) can repair the data as shown in
  this [fixing errors demo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=1453898551545440&set=vb.1452601258341836&type=3&theater).

## Implementation Details

The system is divided into two parts: the internal website that is accessible
only to the trusted volunteers and the external website that is accessible to
the public.

![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajran/kawalpemilu2014/master/doc/images/architecture.svg?sanitize=true)

In addition, we also developed an offline version of the external website that
works with a data dump, allowing users to view the data dump without having to
connect to the external website.

### The Internal Website

The internal website consists of two servers: api-server and auth-server. The
api-server is where the data is stored. We implement our own in-memory database
in C++ hooked up with the [http-server](https://github.com/felix-halim/http-server)
built on top of libuv. This provides a very fast response time. Below is the
sample of latency for the API calls as recorded from our server (hosted in
Amazon EC2 small instance):

![database latency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajran/kawalpemilu2014/master/doc/images/db-latency.png)

The auth-server is where requests that needs authentication is proxied to. We
use [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [passportjs](http://passportjs.org/) to
authenticate the requests and (if authorized) will forward the requests to the
api-server. Requests that do not need authentication can go straight to the
api-server.

The C1 form is structured such that its fourth page contains the data we need,
namely the vote tally of the first candidate, the vote tally of the second
candidate, the total of valid votes, and the total of invalid votes. Therefore,
we concentrate the input interface on this fourth page. The C1 scans of the
fourth page from the KPU website ([scanc1.kpu.go.id/viewp.php](http://scanc1.kpu.go.id/viewp.php?f=000012600104.jpg))
were downloaded offline (around 70GB) and cropped around the “Jumlah” (sum)
column into smaller image (around 10KB) to allow fast display of the snippets
and avoid the problems when KPU website is down (for any reason). Sometimes,
the C1 scans are uploaded incorrectly (e.g., flipped upside down, the page
order is wrong, and the fourth page is not uploaded). To handle this case, we
also provide a link to all four pages (later on we were made aware that a fifth
page exists for several ten thousands of C1 scans).

### The Public Website

The public website initially hosted on Dreamhost and later moved to Google App
Engine (GAE) due to DDoS attacks. It uses memcache to cache and proxy the APIs
exposed by the internal website (with ~5 minute cache expiry). This allows
concurrent development of the website independent from the development of the
data being passed to the website. As a drawback, ordinary users cannot easily
mirror this website, as all data have to be retrieved from the app engine. In
fact, this dynamic property was used to clone the website without any
attribution to kawalpemilu.org (e.g., http://gen-kawalpemilu.com/), while
producing traffic to the app engine. Fortunately, the impact was not dramatic
(in terms of cost) and could be resolved by adding a blacklist based on HTTP
referral and origin headers.

The public website also hosts DA1, DB1, and DC1 recapitulation data provided by
KPU. Originally the data were retrieved from a similar website
(<http://rekapda1.herokuapp.com/>) which scraped the data from KPU website.
However, due to changes in the website that broke our retrieval code, we
decided to scrape the KPU website directly. The scraping code consists of a
couple of python scripts that periodically download and parse the
recapitulation data pages. The data are then combined and served as an API to
be consumed by the public website.

### The Extract Page

To allow standalone mirrors of the public facing website, we developed a
separate page, called the extract page, that incorporates a dump of the data
(in JSON format) all in one single HTML file. This format is chosen such that
it is simple enough to be used by non-technical users (nothing needed to be set
up, only a browser is needed to open the extract). The data format used by the
dynamic site cannot be directly used, as it translates to a bigger extract page
(the final extract page is 19 MB, needing a few seconds to load). We had to
transform the data from the internal server and the recapitulation data scraped
from the KPU website to make it more compact and at the same time easier to
work with.

The extract page provides yet another option to safeguard the data integrity
and quickly rebuild the original website, should the need arise. Additionally,
the static data contained in the extract page allows the development of other
stand alone applications such as the [data visualization](http://www.udagedemasinete.com/escortingelection/index.html)
and [quick count simulation](http://cobaqc.org/) applications. We can also show
how the collected data evolves by using the dumps contained in the revisions of
the extract page.

The extract page does not contain the C1 scan snippets and the jQuery library,
so viewing the full information on a polling station still requires an internet
connection.

The extract page was initially released twice a day. As the data changed more
slowly, we released the page only once a day.

## Statistics

* How many volunteers (exactly), their background, how they were recruited:

  * Recruitment of volunteers was done using a secret facebook group.
    Volunteers who were added into the secret group are encouraged to invite
    their trustworthy facebook friends into the group. It started from 5
    facebook users, all Ainun’s friends, to 700 users in the span of 4 days,
    friends of friends ... of friends.

  * From the 700 users, 431 contributed at least a single entry. Several users
    digitized C1 scans of more than 7000 polling stations.

  * The volunteers come from very diverse backgrounds: from a secondary school
    student (who is not even eligible to vote yet) to a professor, from
    housewives to professionals of various industries, from those who can work
    on kawalpemilu.org full time to those who only have few minutes to spare -
    yet still eager to join and contribute.

* How many person hours were needed to develop and monitor the site (up to 22 July)?

  * Felix spent 20 hours over two days developing the internal website and 10
    hours spreaded over the week on bug fixing and export features.

  * Andrian spent 5 hours coding and many hours on-call monitoring.

  * Ilham spent 30 hours on coding and 20 hours monitoring.

  * Fajran spent 10 hours coding scripts for scraping the recapitulation data
    and scripts for preparing data for the extract page.

* The costs in $$

  * The internal website costs $10.88 per month.

  * The public website costs around $35, including the bandwidth cost incurred
    during the DDoS attempts.

  * The domain (kawalpemilu.org) costs for $9.95 for a year’s registration.

* How many errors the crowdsourcing effort uncovered (both from the internal site and the public site)

  * We discovered around 10 thousands errors (either C1 scan errors or data
    entry error).

  * The data entry errors have been fixed mostly and now around 6 thousands
    errors regarding C1 scans (for any reasons).

  * Until the public announcement of the national level recapitulation, KPU
    still had not uploaded around 10 thousands C1 scans.

* It took 3 days to reach digitize 80% of the C1 scans and 6 days to reach 97%.

  ![digitization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajran/kawalpemilu2014/master/doc/images/digitization-progress.png)

* The number of views to the public website:

  ![views](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajran/kawalpemilu2014/master/doc/images/views.png)

  [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/) estimated on 26-07-2014 that kawalpemilu.org
  ranks 171 in Indonesia in terms of traffic, above groupon.co.id, path.com,
  kontan.co.id, bbc.co.uk, airasia.com, and rumah.com, among others.

  ![alexa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajran/kawalpemilu2014/master/doc/images/alexa.png)

* How stark were the DDoS attacks?

  The figure below shows the requests kawalpemilu.org received since its launch. There were several attack with the most significant attack happened on July 17.

  ![requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajran/kawalpemilu2014/master/doc/images/requests.png)

  The following figure depicts a more detailed account on the worst attack as
  it occurred. At its peak, the website was flooded by 9000 requests per
  second. There was a brief period of unavailability due to the delay in
  AppEngine spinning up new instances to handle the increased traffic, but this
  resolved itself shortly afterwards.

## Our hope for the future

* Improve the _last mile_ Internet speed in Indonesia. We wouldn’t have finished
  developing the website if we were in Jakarta, for example. We couldn’t have
  downloaded the 70GB C1 scans in 2 days.

* Improve IT education in Indonesia. So far, we see again and again that any
  field touched by IT can function significantly more efficient and effective.
  We hope the next election will utilize IT better, by providing a transparent,
  secure and robust site that is open where anyone can verify its correctness
  and thus avoid possibilities of cheating as much as possible.

* Provide a place for professional programmers in Indonesia to grow and
  contribute back to Indonesia. The developers of kawalpemilu.org are all
  Indonesians, living from outside Indonesia: Singapore, USA, Australia,
  Germany and the Netherlands, and the majority are working for foreign
  companies.

* Now we have high quality training data (thanks to the trusted volunteers)
  that can be used to improve research on handwriting recognition for digits.
  When the handwriting recognition is mature enough, we may not need to
  crowdsource as much. Instead the crowdsourcing effort may be geared towards
  corner cases where the handwriting recognition technique does not perform
  well.
